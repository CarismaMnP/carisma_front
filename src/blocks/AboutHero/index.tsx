                        At CARisma M&P, we focus on one thing â€” doing BMW better than anyone else. Based in Jacksonville, Florida, we specialize exclusively in acquiring late-model BMW vehicles with low mileage and carefully dismantling them to offer premium OEM parts with a long remaining service life.
